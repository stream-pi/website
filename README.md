Originally the Stream-Pi website was made with static HTML, and PHP. With the release of Stream-Pi 1.0.0 (now 2.0.0) we thought a redesign was in order to make things more modern. So the site was rebuilt from the ground up using react, typescript, and nextjs.

React brings the Stream-Pi website into the modern era of web development and offers a faster, more robust experience for the end user. NextJS builds upon this with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. without the need for additional configuration.

It'll also in general just be easier to maintain.
